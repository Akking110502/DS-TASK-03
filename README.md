To develop an image classification model to distinguish between cats and dogs using Python, you can follow these steps:

Collect Data: Gather a dataset of labeled images of cats and dogs. You can use publicly available datasets like Kaggle's "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset.

Preprocess Data: Resize the images to a uniform size, normalize pixel values, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Build Model: Use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor or train a CNN from scratch. Popular choices include VGG, ResNet, or Inception.

Train Model: Train the model on the training data and validate it on the testing data. Fine-tune the model if necessary to improve performance.

Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images of cats and dogs.
